<p>Welcome to the Autobiography of My Virtual Insanity. There, you will see the forth the life and times of me, Sagay. <br> We will see forth inside of my mind to see my memories and my actions.</p>

<h2> All about me:</h2>
<p>My name is Sagay, I'm 29 years old and I live on the island of Budud. I tend to the animals and raise crops for my fellow Oddballs and it brings me joy whenever I was able to get a good harvest of Fleets for my community.
    I have several friends, some of which work the same job as me, especially Jacobine, whom I always look forward to seeing everyday. I was a honest and hardworking man who sees the beauty in its simplicity. However,
everything changed when something crashed into my yard and ever since then, I drove into a rabbit hole so deep, I could never get out.</p>

<h2>My early years:</h2>
